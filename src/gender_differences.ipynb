      "My son is getting married soon. Due to a complicated past, we've only just met recently. We've been building a relationship the last few years though and I am lucky to have him in my life now. Recently, he asked me to do a reading with his father while I am honored I told him no. His step-mother practically raised him from a baby and I think that she deserves it far more than me. He was really upset and hurt when I said no. Am I a jerk?'\n"

Recently, he found out how much money my parents send me each month and freaked out, saying it wasn't fair that I was making him split things 50/50. I told him it was my money, and it only seems fair if we cover half the expenses. Am I a jerk?\n"
